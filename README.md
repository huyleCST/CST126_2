**Unresolved Issues:**

**Notes:**
While the output matches exactly. I have made several changes to make it work. First, it is a txt file. 
I have trouble removing commas separating the words. Reformating the file is for the sake of getting the assignment done. Also,
I did not use learning concepts of the lab as I am supposed to. While turing in thsi lab, I will continue working on version of 
this lab using the learning objects and hope I would get partial credits once it is finished.
